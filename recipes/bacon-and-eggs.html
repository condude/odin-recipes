        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Eggs and bacon are meant to go together. Together, they are the foundation of the best meal of the day: Breakfast. There are plenty of different ways to cook these and bring them together. This is my go-to breakfast combo.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat medium castiron skillet over medium-high</li>
            <li>Once hot place bacon slices onto skillet and turn heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Cook, flipping regularly, until desired readiness, 8 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Move bacon to plate and pat with paper towels to remove grease.</li>
            <li>Pour out some of the skillet grease into a disposable container, keeping enough to barely cover the bottom of the skillet. </li>
            <li>Crack eggs directly into skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook to desired readiness, 3-5 minutes on both sides.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Favorite dessert? Kentucky Derby Pie. Favorite Thanksgiving dish? Kentucky Derby Pie. I have found nothing else that compares to the taste sensation brought about by the combination of chocolate, bourbon, pecans, and brown sugar in this most glorious of pies. This recipe ain't the one my mom makes. But its close enough.</p>
